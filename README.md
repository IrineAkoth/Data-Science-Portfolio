# Exploration of the COVID19 Pandemic Across countries in the world.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

I wanted to explore how COVID-19 has impacted different counries across the globe, and which anti- pandemic efforts have been effective in combating its spread.

**Datasets**

Two datasets were used for analysis.

The first dataset provides data on the fatalities from COVID-19 across different countries, and this dataset was provided by 'Our World In Data'.

The second dataset provides data on the anti-pandemic measures taken by different governments, and it's provided by ACAPS, which is a non-profit project that provides international, independent humanitarian analysis (according to Wikipedia).

**Data wrangling steps prior to conducting analysis included:**

Renaming column headers
Dropping unnecessary columns
Dropping duplicate rows
Convert object header types to categorical datatypes
Convert object header for the date, to the datetime format
Merge data sets
Filtering the data set to only include data for select countries


**Summary of Findings**

Initial analysis indicates a strong response against the pandemic from all governments under analysis based on their Stringency Index.
Further investigation revealed that not all responses were neither strong, nor appropriate, in successfully controlling the pandemic.
The fatality rates of some of the select countries has been investigated in the presentation.
Analysis indicates that the countries that successfully controlled the pandemic all used lockdowns and strict movement restrictions.
